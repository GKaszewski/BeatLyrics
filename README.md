# BeatLyrics
Adds lyrics to Beat Saber. It's a fork of BeatSinger by Gr√©goire Geis

[BeatSinger](https://github.com/71/BeatSinger)

## Installation
This mod depends on [SongCore](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/SongCore), you need it for this mod to function properly. If you have SongCore installed drop the BeatLyrics.dll
into Plugins folder.

## How to use this mod
This mod uses srt files to get the lyrics data. For each level you need to put an srt file into level's folder.
For example:
1. Go to Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels
2. Go to your chosen level directory
3. Put `lyrics.srt` file there. (**IMPORTANT** the lyrics file must be named **lyrics.srt** otherwise it will not load.)
4. Open Beat saber, choose your level and enjoy the lyrics!

## Tools
In near future I am going to create a tool that lets you generate srt file for now you can use already available online tools.
